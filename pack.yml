noise:

  imageNoiseMountains:
    # This is an image noise sampler:
    type: Image
    image: images/heightmaps/mountain_1.png
    channel: GRAYSCALE
    frequency: 1  #  Lower frequency   =  stretch the image to make larger
                  #
                  #  Higher frequency  =   squish the image to make smaller
                  #
                  # A frequency of 1 means 1 pixel = 1 block
                  #
                  # I would not suggest any frequency below 1 for image
                  # noise samplers, as you will lose detail!

biomes:

  type: PIPELINE
    # Here PIPELINE is used instead of IMAGE, such that
    # we can randomize some aspects of biome arrangement
    # instead of having EVERYTHING determined by an image.
    #
    # You could use the IMAGE provider if you want to define
    # exactly how every biome is arranged, however with
    # PIPELINE, we can do things like arrange just the land
    # and water, and get the biome pipeline to randomize
    # everything else.
    #
    # In this example, the mountain climates will be dictated
    # by an image, while the variations of biomes within those
    # climates will be randomized by some noise.

  resolution: 1
    # Having a resolution of 1 gives a 1:1 block to pixel ratio
    # at the cost of some performance. For this example it's fine
    # since the pipeline is fairly simple, but for more complicated
    # pipeline setups, I would recommend setting the resolution
    # higher (around 3-5), so that things stay performant.
    #
    # If you make the resolution higher, and still want to retain
    # the 1:1 ratio, modify the frequency of your image noise samplers
    # within the pipeline such that they equal the resolution.
    #
    #   For example, increasing the resolution to 4 will stretch things
    #   by a factor of 4, so increasing the frequency of the image sampler
    #   to 4 will squish it by a factor of 4, effectively retaining the
    #   same ratio of blocks to pixels (just with lower quality biome sampling).
